EasyLight -- The bright flashlight application for Android
==========================================================

Even though there are other open source flashlight applications out there, this one is using elementary principles of the MVC pattern.
A <b>service</b> is used to communicate with the flashlight and this allows the use as <b>standard app</b> and also as <b>widget</b>.

The source code for this app will always be available at:
